SMUDS HW-15 Bio-Diversity Website

This project uses Javascript to read json data files containing bacteriological data for patients. 
Then based on user input, that data is displayed graphically and updated using Javascript to dynamically control the web page HTML/CSS.
This was the most enjoyable project because of the dynamic user interaction capabilities and the visual/graphic results it produced.
